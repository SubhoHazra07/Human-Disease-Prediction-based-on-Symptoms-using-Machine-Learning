# Human-Disease-Prediction-based-on-Symptoms-using-Machine-Learning
This project predicts diseases based on user-provided symptoms using multiple machine learning models (Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, KNN). Each model independently predicts a disease, and the final result is determined by a majority-vote approach. It aims to assist in early disease detection.
